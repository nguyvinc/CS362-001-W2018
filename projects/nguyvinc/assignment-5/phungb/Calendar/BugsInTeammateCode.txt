Bugs Detected:

	CalendarUtil Class:
1.		NumDaysInMonth function, line 32
		function checks if the month "!=" February instead of "=="
		so on a leap year, all months except February get one extra day.
		
		
2.		IsLeapYear function, lines 46, 48, and 56
		function checks if the year modded by leap years "!=" 0 instead of "=="
		so all leap years are not considered leap years and all non-leap years are
		considered leap years.
		
		
	Appt Class:
3.		isValid function, line 119
		function checks if startMinute is ">10" instead of ">59" so all valid appointments
		with startMinutes between 11 and 59 are considered invalid.
	
	
	TimeTable Class:
4.		deleteAppt function, line 214
		function immediately adds the deleted appointment back into the list
		so the function basically does nothing.
		

5.		getApptRange function, line 58
		function arguments "firstDay" and "lastDay" were swapped in the getApptOccurences
		function call, so the function never added any appointments to the calendar.
